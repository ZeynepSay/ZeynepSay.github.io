Ontology for Pharmaceutical Science Research
===================
An ontology about pharmaceutical research publications. The main theme of the ontology is to access pharmaceutical research findings with defining the structure of the entire scientific article using metadata and data to provide meaningful published information. This ontology defines the pharmaceutical science domain for scientific publishing to reach specific concepts; clinical studies, experiments, experiment methods and materials, intervention and procedures, diseases, drugs, genes, cell lines, reagents, bioassays and treatments.


PharmSci provides concepts to describe all aspects of how research in the pharmaceutical science domain is conducted. he purpose ofthe PharmSci ontology is to contribute to pharmaceutical research by making datathat is easier to access, reuse, curate and integrate from documented research.PharmSci is an Ontology for describing Pharmaceutical Science research. Classes were modelled to represent clinical study (e.g clinical trial,clinical data, problem, procedures), material (e.g. reagent, gene, cell lines, probe),method (e.g. experiment, treatment, assay), patient (e.g. disease, specimen) andinformational entities (e.g. problem, objective, evidence) of relevance to our study. The aim of building ontology is to help Pharmaceutical Science researchers to find scientific research close to their work or their research topic. Ontology covers the study design for pharmaceutical science research which is a Clinical Study that includes experimental and non-experimental studies.
